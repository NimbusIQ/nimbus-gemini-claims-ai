## 1. Company Overview
Nimbus Roofing AI is a **vertical SaaS** company building the "Autonomous Operating System" for the $156B Roofing & Restoration industry. We replace fragmented, manual legacy workflows with a unified platform powered by **Sovereign AI Agents**.

Our mission is to move construction companies from "manually managed" to "autonomously executed" by deploying AI that can see (Vision), think (Reasoning), and act (Tools).

## 2. The Problem
The restoration industry loses **$3.2 Billion annually** due to administrative inefficiencies:
*   **Forensic Inaccuracy:** Human inspectors miss 30% of storm damage.
*   **Claims Leakage:** Contractors fail to document code requirements, leaving ~18% of claim value on the table.
*   **Labor Shortage:** High turnover in project management and sales roles creates operational bottlenecks.

## 3. The Solution: Nimbus Roofing AI OS
A unified "Super App" built on Google Cloud Vertex AI that automates the four core business pillars:

1.  **Acquisition (Market Authority):** "Zero-Click" generative SEO that auto-publishes storm guides to capture traffic.
2.  **Forensics (Roof Inspector):** AR/Computer Vision (Gemini 3 Vision) that identifies hail hits with 99.7% accuracy.
3.  **Monetization (Claims Intelligence):** An agent that audits insurance scopes against 40,000+ municipal building codes using BigQuery RAG pipelines.
4.  **Governance (Security Ops):** Enterprise-grade compliance and security foundations from day one.

## 4. Market Opportunity
*   **TAM (Total Addressable Market):** $156B (US Roofing Services)
*   **SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market):** $12B (Construction Software Spend)
*   **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):** $150M (Initial target: Top 200 US Restoration Firms)

## 5. Traction & Metrics
*   **Beta Users:** 500+ Contractors
*   **Claims Processed:** $45M+ in value
*   **Avg. Lift per Claim:** $4,200 (via Claims Intelligence module)
*   **Automation Rate:** 95% of estimation data entry is now autonomous.

## 6. Business Model
**B2B SaaS Subscription + Usage Fees:**
*   **Seat License:** $199/user/month
*   **AI Usage:** $25 per Roof Scan / $50 per Claim Audit
*   **Enterprise:** Custom implementation for carriers and large GCs.

## 7. Technology Stack (Google Cloud Native)
*   **AI Models:** Gemini 3 (Nano Banana) for Edge/Vision, Gemini 2.5 Pro (Reasoning), Imagen 3 (Simulation).
*   **Data & RAG:** BigQuery Vector Search for automated code matching.
*   **Communications:** Google Voice API (SMS) and Gmail API (Email Notifications).
*   **Compute:** Cloud Run (Serverless), GKE Autopilot.
*   **Security:** Chronicle, Security Command Center, Identity-Aware Proxy.

## 8. The Ask: Google for Startups Cloud Program
We are applying for the Google for Startups Cloud Program to:
1.  **Scale Inference:** Cover the costs of high-volume Gemini Reasoning calls for our "Claims Intelligence" engine.
2.  **Infrastructure Security:** Implement the "Security Foundations Blueprint" to become SOC2 compliant for enterprise insurance carrier contracts.
3.  **Technical Mentorship:** Access Googlers for guidance on optimizing our Multi-Agent "ADK" Architecture.
